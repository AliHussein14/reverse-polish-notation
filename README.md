Reverse Polish Notation


Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is a way to represent mathematical expressions that are easy for computers to read. In this
exercise, we're going to create a limited RPN calculator.
In RPN, two numbers come first, followed by an operator. It is evaluated left to right, so the result of the previous expression
is used in the next. 


My Solution:


solution should take input from the user for an RPN expression, evaluate it, then print the output.
